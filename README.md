A noob's try to build a block-chain technology to demostrate the ideas and logic behind the technology.

Clone the repository in your workspace.<br />
I have used VS Code as Text-Editor : https://code.visualstudio.com/download<br />
Install Node.js - latest version from here depending on your system : https://nodejs.org/en/download/<br />
I am using a crypto-js library for using the hash algorithm and its included with the repository so no need to install separately.<br />
To run the script, save the file and open terminal.<br />
Check node is installed properly by this command: node --version<br />
If it shows a version that means it is properly installed.<br />
Now type the command to run : node main.js<br />
