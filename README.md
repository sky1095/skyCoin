# skyCoin
A noob's try to build a block-chain technology to demostrate the ideas and logic behind the technology.

Clone the repository in your workspace.
I have used VS Code as Text-Editor : https://code.visualstudio.com/download
Install Node.js - latest version from here depending on your system : https://nodejs.org/en/download/
I am using a crypto-js library for using the hash algorithm and its included with the repository so no need to install separately.
To run the script, save the file and open terminal.
Check node is installed properly by this command: node --version
If it shows a version that means it is properly installed.
Now type the command to run : node main.js
